                <p>So you have decided you want to try your hand at Dungeons and Dragons.  The game has been around since the 1970's with numerous changes and revisions over the years.  You didn't come here for a history lesson, you came to slay goblins, orcs, and dragons.  We can get you going on your path with a minimal financial commitment until you know if you have the heart of a true adventurer.</p>

                <p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>
